# Deep Learning for Imbalanced Time Series Clinical Data

**Technologies Used**: TensorFlow, Deep Learning, Hyperparameter Tuning, Transformer SMOTE

## Project Overview
This project focuses on improving the performance of classifiers on imbalanced time series clinical data using a deep learning approach, integrating advanced techniques to handle data imbalance.

### Key Highlights:
- **Time Series Classification**: Developed 10 classification models, experimenting with various architectures, including Simplified Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Echo State Cells and Transformers.
- **Feature Selection**: Incorporated Random Forest for feature selection to improve model efficiency and performance.
- **Imbalance Handling**: Utilized SMOTE and Borderline SMOTE to address data imbalance, achieving a 49% reduction in data skew.
- **Model Performance**: Achieved a Test AUC of 95% after optimizing model hyperparameters through comprehensive tuning.

### Tools and Techniques:
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework for building and training the classification models.
- **SMOTE**: Applied SMOTE and Borderline SMOTE for synthetic oversampling of the minority class.
